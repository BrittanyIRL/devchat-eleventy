  "title": "JavaScript as a build target",
  "description": "Browsers only speak JavaScript, so we are forced to use this language. Or are we? Maybe we can just change the perspective and stop thinking of JavaScript as a programming language but rather as an environment or a “build target”.  During this talk, I'm going to explore our options for having JavaScript without writing JavaScript. I will walk you through statically typed JavaScript flavors and tell why would we want to use any of them.",
