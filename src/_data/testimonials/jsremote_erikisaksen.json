  "testimonial": "I attended the JavaScript remote conf. What I really like about the remote conf series in general is the surprising fact that no matter how many people were in attendance, every single person could easily ask questions, strike conversations up, and feel connected to the speakers. I usually have a lot going on at home and Itâ€™s hard to be away from the family. With a remote conference I can do everything from the comfort of my own home. There are No traveling or crazy expenses, no taking off of work to go to a conference, and a forum that is great for networking and to deep dive into topics related to the conf. Also ...I can rewatch the videos whenever I like in case I missed something. I was so impressed, I contacted other developers and we started our own remote conference under Charles' guidance. Thank you Charles for your dedication to the software developer community.",
