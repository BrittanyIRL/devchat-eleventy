  "bio": "Brittany is a software engineer at Formidable focused on front-end development. Prior to joining Formidable in early 2019, she helped scale e-commerce sites, implemented component libraries, and transitioned existing sites to React in a high-paced environment. She is passionate about accessibility, responsive UI, and clean development patterns. She holds a bachelor’s degree in sociology, allowing her to approach engineering with a holistic focus on usability and a sense of responsibility to make things better for all stakeholders. Brittany wants to see tech become more diverse, and has led a chapter of Girls Who Code in Phoenix to become more invested in her local development community. When she’s not at a computer, you’ll find her baking or DJing.",
