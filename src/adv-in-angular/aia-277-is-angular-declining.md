Alyssa, Chris, and Chuck dive into whether or not Angular is declining in popularity. They begin talking about a tweet by [@wellpaidgeek](https://twitter.com/WellPaidGeek) and things like State of JS and what it says about the growth and relative popularity of Angular when compared with Vue, React, and Svelte. The discussion also weaves into whether or not it's worth starting in or finding a job in today.
