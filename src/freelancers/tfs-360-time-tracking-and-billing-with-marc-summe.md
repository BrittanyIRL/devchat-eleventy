Marc Summe and the freelancing panel discuss the ins and outs of tracking time and billing for your time. Time tracking seems deceptively simple, but it gets complicated when you actually try to do it. You also have to decide what you are tracking time for and billing for and how to get your timesheet transferred to an invoice. This episode will answers all your questions about how to track your time and get paid for it.
