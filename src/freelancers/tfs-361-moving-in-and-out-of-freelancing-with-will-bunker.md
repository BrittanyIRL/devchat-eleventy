This week's guest of The Freelancers' Show, Will Bunker has had a long career in programming and has moved several times between freelancing and full time work. We discuss how he finds clients, his strategy for getting referrals, and how he spots what the next 5-7 year wave of popular technology will be and how he prepares for it. We also discussed a non-niche approach to being a freelancer and what kind of person might enjoy that and how to be successful at it.
